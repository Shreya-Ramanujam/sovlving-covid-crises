      <h1 id="h1-0">Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?</h1><br><br>
      <p id="p00">Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses <br>
     behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory <br>
     syndrome (SARS) got started. <br><br>
    
     SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet <br>
     markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals <br>
     that are killed on the spot. <br><br>
    
     Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and <br>
     raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap <br>
     genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread <br>
     among people.</p><br><br>
      <h1 id="h1-1">Coronavirus Evolution</h1><br><br>
      <p id="p0">Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common <br>
     cold.Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal <br>
     viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance. <br><br>
     
     Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in <br>
    southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than <br>
    8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 <br>
    involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and <br>
    respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.</p><br>
